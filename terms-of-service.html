      <h3 class="fs-2">General Terms</h3>
<p class="text-dark">When you choose wedevlope, you're not just signing up for a service&mdash;you&rsquo;re entering into a partnership with us. We aim to deliver high-quality digital solutions that are tailored to your business needs. In doing so, we maintain the highest level of professionalism and commitment, ensuring that our services meet your expectations.</p>
<p class="text-dark">The terms outlined here apply to all users of our website and services, including anyone who accesses, browses, or contributes content to the site. By engaging with our website and services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these terms.</p>
<h3 class="fs-2">Services Offered</h3>
<p class="text-dark">We offer a variety of digital services, including but not limited to web development, digital marketing, SEO services, and mobile app development. While we strive to provide flawless execution, you agree that the scope of each project will be clearly defined in the proposal or contract prior to the commencement of any work. Both parties must agree on the deliverables, timelines, and pricing.</p>
<h3 class="fs-2">Client Responsibilities</h3>
<p class="text-dark">In order for us to provide the best possible service, we need your cooperation. As our client, it&rsquo;s important that you provide us with timely feedback, materials, and information necessary for completing the project. Communication is key to ensuring the smooth execution of your project, and we&rsquo;ll make every effort to keep things running efficiently on our end.</p>
<p class="text-dark">If there are any delays on your part in providing the required inputs, it may result in adjustments to the project timeline or additional costs, as agreed upon during the planning process. By staying engaged and responsive, we can ensure a more productive partnership and keep your project on track.</p>
<h3 class="fs-2">Intellectual Property</h3>
<p class="text-dark">All content, designs, code, and other materials created by wedevlope are the intellectual property of our company unless otherwise agreed upon. Upon final payment, you will receive the rights to the finished product. However, we retain the right to showcase the work in our portfolio or marketing materials, unless explicitly prohibited in the contract.</p>
<p class="text-dark">It's important to note that you must not use, reproduce, or distribute any of our proprietary material without our express permission. This helps protect the integrity of our work and ensures that both parties benefit from our collaboration.</p>
<h3 class="fs-2">Payments and Fees</h3>
<p class="text-dark">Our pricing structure is clear and transparent. You will be provided with an agreed-upon quote before any work begins. Payment terms and schedules will also be outlined in the contract. Payments are typically required in stages, with a percentage due upfront and subsequent payments tied to specific project milestones.</p>
<p class="text-dark">In the event of late payments, we reserve the right to pause the project until payment is received. Any delays resulting from non-payment could affect the delivery timeline. Should disputes arise regarding payments or fees, we encourage open communication so that any issues can be resolved swiftly and amicably.</p>
<h3 class="fs-2">Revisions and Changes</h3>
<p class="text-dark">At wedevlope, we understand that changes happen. That&rsquo;s why we allow for a reasonable number of revisions to your project as outlined in the contract. Revisions beyond the agreed-upon scope will incur additional charges. We&rsquo;ll always inform you beforehand if an adjustment requires extra work or payment.</p>
<p class="text-dark">It&rsquo;s essential that any revisions or new requests are communicated as soon as possible. We want to make sure that your project reflects your vision, but unexpected changes can sometimes impact deadlines or costs.</p>
<h3 class="fs-2">Termination of Services</h3>
<p class="text-dark">Either party may terminate the project at any time by providing written notice. If you decide to terminate before completion, you will be required to pay for the work already completed. Any work delivered before termination will still be subject to the agreed-upon terms of use, and we will no longer be obligated to provide services under that project once it has been terminated.</p>
<p class="text-dark">In rare cases, if we determine that it is no longer feasible to continue the project due to a breach of the terms or other unforeseen circumstances, we reserve the right to terminate our services. In such cases, we will notify you promptly and outline the reasons for termination.</p>
<h4 class="fs-2">Privacy and Data Protection</h4>
<p class="text-dark">We take your privacy seriously. Any personal or business information provided to us will be used solely for the purposes of delivering the services you've requested. We will not share your information with third parties without your consent, except as required by law or necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations.</p>
<p class="text-dark">We employ industry-standard practices to safeguard your data and ensure that it remains confidential. However, you acknowledge that no method of data transmission over the internet is entirely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>
<h4 class="fs-2">Limitations of Liability</h4>
<p class="text-dark">While we strive for excellence in every project, there may be situations beyond our control. wedevlope is not responsible for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages that arise from the use of our services. This includes, but is not limited to, damages caused by system failures, viruses, or any unauthorized access to your data.</p>
