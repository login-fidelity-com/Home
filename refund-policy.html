                <li><i class="fa-solid fa fa-arrow-circle-right"></i> Projects begin with thorough analysis and a scope
                    document to ensure clarity and alignment. </li>
                <li><i class="fa-solid fa fa-arrow-circle-right"></i> Milestones are set to track progress and
                    guarantee both parties stay synchronized.</li>
                <li><i class="fa-solid fa fa-arrow-circle-right"></i> A detailed scope helps prevent disputes and
                    reduces the risk of project cancellations.</li>
                <li><i class="fa-solid fa fa-arrow-circle-right"></i> Refunds are not possible for completed work due
                    to invested time and resources.</li>
                <li><i class="fa-solid fa fa-arrow-circle-right"></i> If a project is mutually discontinued, payments
                    cover completed work; future development payments are void.</li>
                <li><i class="fa-solid fa fa-arrow-circle-right"></i> No refunds will be issued for any preceding
                    payments or deposits once a project starts.</li>
                <li><i class="fa-solid fa fa-arrow-circle-right"></i> Upon mock-up approval, client payments become
                    non-refundable as development begins immediately.</li>
                <li><i class="fa-solid fa fa-arrow-circle-right"></i> Clients cannot expect partial refunds for
                    projects if they are stopped midway through initial phases.</li>
                <li><i class="fa-solid fa fa-arrow-circle-right"></i> Special marketing service costs, once agreed, are
                    irrevocable due to their time-sensitive nature.</li>
                <li><i class="fa-solid fa fa-arrow-circle-right"></i> Deposits for dormant projects inactive for over
                    30 days are non-refundable.</li>
                <li><i class="fa-solid fa fa-arrow-circle-right"></i> Refunds are not available for services that have
                    been partially or fully completed.</li>
                <li><i class="fa-solid fa fa-arrow-circle-right"></i> Any disputes or concerns should be addressed
                    promptly to avoid complications with refunds.</li>
                <li><i class="fa-solid fa fa-arrow-circle-right"></i> Clear communication is essential to avoid
